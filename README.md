# CSCI-3308-Project
CSCI 3308 Project Team 4 (Festive Haircut)

Team Members: Arash Yousefzadeh, Numair Baig, Ruijiang Ma, Elijah Aldinger, and Charles Bourland

Unfortunately we did not have enough time to develop a fully fleshed video game. We severely underestimated the work load involved in this project in conjunction with our other classes. The only way to view our project is to clone the git repository and run the html files locally.

Structure:
  - PUN2Test: Files for for photon network
  - SQLTest: Files for the database
  - Webpage: Contains the login page which connects to the database
  - All committed to master

 How to Run:
  - Enter the Webpage folder and then the Pages subfolder
  - Open up home.html
  - Be transferred to the website that will hold the game, and the game will start
  - Controls
    - Arrow keys (movement)
    - Space Bar (Jump)
